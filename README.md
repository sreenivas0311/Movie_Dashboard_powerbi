## 🎬 Movie Data Analysis & Dashboards

✅ **Project Overview**  

In this project, we analyzed a comprehensive movie dataset by performing **data cleaning** to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize fields like **budget, revenue, ratings, genres, and release details**. After preparing the data, we leveraged **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create calculated columns and measures for essential metrics such as:

- 💰 Profit & ROI  
- ⭐ Rating averages  
- 📊 Revenue comparisons  
- 📈 Performance scores  

To present insights clearly, we developed **three separate interactive dashboards in Power BI**, each focused on a unique analytical perspective:

---

### 💵 Financial Analysis Dashboard
Highlights **budget, profit, revenue trends, ROI**, and financial performance by directors, locations, and budget categories.

### 🎭 Audience Rating Dashboard
Focuses on **viewer perception** using IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings across languages, genres, certification types, and production companies.

**Overall**, this project demonstrates **end-to-end execution** including:

- 🧹 Data cleaning & preparation  
- ⚡ DAX-based calculations for insightful metrics
