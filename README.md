✅ Project Overview

In this project, we analyzed a comprehensive movie dataset by first performing thorough data cleaning to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure uniform formatting across fields like budget, revenue, ratings, genres, and release details. After preparing the data, we used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures for essential metrics such as profit, ROI, rating averages, revenue comparison, and performance scores.

To make the insights clear and actionable, we developed three separate interactive dashboards in Power BI, each focused on a different analytical perspective:

Financial Analysis Dashboard – Highlights budget, profit, revenue trends, ROI, and financial performance by directors, locations, and budget categories.

Audience Rating Dashboard – Focuses on viewer perception through IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings across languages, genres, certification types, and production companies.

Genre Rating Dashboard – Compares the performance of movie genres in terms of count, revenue, profit, ratings, and trends over time.

Overall, this project demonstrates end-to-end execution involving data cleaning, DAX-based calculations, and the creation of insightful dashboards for financial, audience, and genre-based analysis.
